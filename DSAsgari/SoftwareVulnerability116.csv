Hence, it handles large-scale, geographically distributed, and latency-sensitive services. However, there are several security challenges that must be addressed due to the unreliable nature of this architecture. One can cite the verification of data integrity among the most critical issues in the context of fog computing. In fact, since data is often stored dynamically in a fully distributed manner, traditional solutions based on a centralized third-party auditor for integrity verification become unsuitable for such highly dynamic and distributed contexts. Indeed, the constant transfer of data to and from the central auditor results in high network latency and potential bottlenecks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new efficient public verification protocol that ensures the integrity of the data in fog computing architecture. Our solution protects data integrity and authenticity using the short integer solution problem (SIS) and identity-based signatures. Moreover, in order to legitimately modify the data, our protocol allows to distributively identify the data owners and to delegate their signatures to other entities in the architecture. Furthermore, it enables effective data integrity verification even when data is separately shared across several servers. This verification can be performed by any legitimate end user connected to the architecture, and without relying on any trusted third party. Finally, we prove that our protocol is highly efficient and outperforms existing solutions, as demonstrated by our extensive simulations and thorough security analysis that confirmed its security. © 2023","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169977661"

The aim of privacy preserving statistical algorithms is to allow inference to be drawn on the joint data without disclosing private data held by each party. This paper presents a privacy-preserving expectation–maximization (PPEM) algorithm for carrying out maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of mixture models. We address the scenario of horizontally partitioned data distributed among three or more parties. The PPEM algorithm is a two-cycle iterative distributed algorithm for fitting mixture models under privacy-preserving requirements. A distinct advantage of PPEM is that it does not require a trusted third party for cooperative learning, unlike most existing schemes that implement a master/slave hierarchy. By adopting a ring topology and adding random noises to messages before encryption, PPEM helps prevent information leakage in the case of corrupted parties. Furthermore, in contrast to existing works, which typically assume a Honest-but-Curious adversary, we consider the much stronger case of a Malicious adversary. For illustration, PPEM is applied to two of the most popular mixture models, namely, the normal mixture model (NMM) and t-mixture model (tMM), and their effectiveness is analyzed through a security analysis. A real data example is also presented to evaluate the computational complexity and accuracy of PPEM relative to its non-privacy-preserving version. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062533835"

Its independence leads to more and more significant problems of network isolation. To address the problem of the cooperative operation between different blockchains, this article proposes virtual chain, a storage model supporting cross-blockchain transaction. It not only ensures that cross-chain transactions are tamper-proof and traceable but also realizes completely decentralized storage. First, to tackle the multidimensional heterogeneous problem existing in cross-chain trading, a data structure based on prefix tree is proposed to manage cross-chain trading data on top of source chain and target chain. Second, a signature verification mechanism based on elliptic curve is proposed to meet the operational atomicity requirements of both parties of cross-chain transaction. Third, the data fusion technology is used to expand the block capacity indirectly to achieve the high throughput of cross-chain transactions. Finally, by using the credibility-based access control and block chain technology to ensure the security of the data storage model, and conduct security analysis from three aspects of tamper-proof, data protection and anti-conspiracy node attack. The experiment shows that the proposed cross-chain transaction storage model can realize the efficient storage of the heterogeneous data, and satisfy the high requirement of the cross-chain transaction. Moreover, the virtual chain storage model establishes a safe and reliable working environment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090446325"

CPPS can be treated as a typical hierarchical control system (HCS) which can be divided into two parts: power grid and communication network, and four layers: physical layer, secondary device layer, zone control layer and control layer. Compared with traditional power systems, CPPS will face new contingencies, especially from communication networks which can cause cascading consequences. To address this challenge, a vulnerability assessment using double power flow method is proposed in this paper. In addition, a whole CPPS model including four layers is presented. The model is based on the IEEE 39-bus network using MATLAB and MATPOWER toolbox. The model contains double power flows, one is to simulate the virtual power flow driven by the decision from the control centre and second one is to simulate the actual power flow. During a cyber-attack, the results from the double power flow method demonstrate a difference which serves as an indicator that a cyber-attack has occurred. The proposed novel vulnerability assessment index considers cyber latency, voltage variation and node centrality as three key parameters in comparing the importance of different nodes. The results can quantify the vulnerabilities in cyber nodes and assess the impact for cyber security strategy. © 2022 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The aircraft systems were simple, obscure, proprietary and, most importantly for security, the systems have been either physically isolated or they have been connected by directed communication links. The union of the aircraft systems thus formed a federated network. These properties are in sharp contrast with today's system designs, which rest upon platform-based solutions with shared resources being interconnected by a massively meshed and shared communication network. The resulting connectivity and the high number of interfaces require an in-depth security analysis as the systems also provide functions that are required for the safe operation of the aircraft. This network design evolution, however, resulted in an iterative and continuous adaption of existing network solutions as these have not been developed from scratch. Now, with the upcoming trend of data analytics and artificial intelligence applications, which demand for an extensive availability of data, holistic aircraft cabin networks are necessary to satisfy the associated requirements. For the development of such networks this paper proposes a novel design approach that includes security considerations as an integral part rather than as an isolated activity. The approach does not restrict itself to a specific class of network architectures, but takes the complete solution space into account. The resulting design decisions are based multiple classes of requirements, namely functional requirements such as the communication need and security requirements, e.g. the unwanted remote controlling of system functions by injecting incorrect information as well as the contract-based data exchange. © 2019 SAE International.

Smart contract, a computer program, can help Ethereum to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. Because the smart contract usually handles large number of cryptocurrencies worth billions of dollars apiece, its security has gained considerable attention. In this paper, we first investigate the security of smart contracts running on the Ethereum and introduce several new security vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to exploit and gain financial benefits. Then, we propose a more practical smart contract analysis tool termed NeuCheck, in which we introduce the syntax tree in the syntactical analyzer to complete the transformation from source code to intermediate representation, and then adopt the open source library working with XML to analyze such tree. We have built a prototype of NeuCheck for Ethereum and evaluate it with over 52 000 existing Ethereum smart contracts.

Based on the secrets in the CHF, a trusted authorizer (TA) can issue identities to all RSUs and vehicles. An identity contains one public ID and one private key. The vehicles use the public ID and the private key to ask RSUs for MRSP information. Using the MRSP information, the vehicles can ask other RSUs for new MRSP information in the next time slot, or exchange the information about index set of random secret to build a neighbor set without any negotiation. To generate MRSP information, a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) is maintained by every RSU. A seed value of a PRNG is broadcast by TA in every time slot to generate a common secret pool in every RSU. This paper proposes a fully anonymous message authentication scheme.

However, WSNs are vulnerable to various attacks over wireless links, such as eavesdropping and tampering. How to ensure that sensitive or critical information is only available to legal users becomes a challenging issue. Two-factor authentication combining password and smart card perfectly matches this requirement because of its practicality. However, a dozen of two-factor authentication protocols have been suggested in recent years. Owing to the challenging mission of reconciling efficiency and security requirements, it is still challenging to propose a privacy-aware two-factor protocol that is capable of providing various security features while maintaining acceptable efficiency. In this paper, we put forward a privacy-aware two-factor authentication protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography for WSNs. Our new protocol accomplishes various security features necessary for real-life application environments while maintaining acceptable efficiency.

One of the major weaknesses of IoT devices is the absence of appropriate mechanisms for firmware and configuration updates. In addition, improved security concepts often result in poor usability which discourages users from relying on these concepts. Therefore, in this paper, we present an easy-to-use NFC-based configuration approach for IoT devices that is secured by appropriate security measures in software and hardware. Since industrial usage of such a configuration approach entails different requirements than home usage, we present and compare three different configuration processes. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated by two prototypical implementations, as well as a detailed security analysis. We also show that the imposed overhead due to the implemented security measures is negligible for most configuration updates. © 2017 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050105044"

Secure storage and privacy preservation are indispensable for the outsourced medical/ health data in cloud computing. In this paper, we study the integrity checking and sharing of outsourced private medical/health records for critical patients in public clouds (ICS).

In this paper, two models of our scheme are verifiable, supporting location query on homomorphic encrypted ciphertext with searching index and trapdoor. The characteristics of our scheme are that it (1) allows users to share their current location without leaking any location information to the untrusted server; (2) protects users from the cheating of untrusted server's malicious behavior by verifying query result; (3) supports a novel personalized query according to users' classifications of social network friends; (4) the user does not have to be online to make permissions for accessing his shared location, and (5) model 2 does not rely on any trusted third party server to perform any computation.

With the continuous updating of core technologies such as artificial intelligence, sensor detection, synchronous positioning, and high-precision mapping, the development of AV has been promoted. When 5G network is combined with Internet of Vehicles, the problems of AV can be solved by taking advantage of 5G ultra-large bandwidth, low latency and high reliability. However, when the user controls the vehicle remotely, a real-time and reliable authentication process is needed, while minimizing the overhead of security protocols. Therefore, this article proposes a practical and secure multifactor user authentication protocol for AV in 5G network. By introducing non-interactive zero-knowledge proof technology and physical uncloning function, the protocol completes mutual authentication and key agreement without revealing any sensitive information. The article proves the security of the protocol through BAN logic and the simulation of Scyther. And it can resist malicious attacks and provide more security features. The informal security analysis shows that the protocol can meet the proposed security requirements. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the protocol, and the results show that the protocol can provide better performance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Conference paper","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128009928"

However, the increasing penetration of converter interfaced sources (CIS) (e.g. wind, PV, HVDC systems, etc.) could significantly reduce the system fault level and change the fault characteristics, thus presenting challenges to the reliable operation of LCD protection. In this paper, the impact of the integration of CIS on LCD performance is investigated comprehensively. Analytical expressions representing LCD relay operation in the presence of converter-driven fault currents and weak infeed conditions have been developed. A test network, comprising of a CIS model equipped with a typical converter fault-ride through strategy that is compliant with the GB Grid Code, has been built in a Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). Simulations of LCD performance for different fault and system conditions are performed and presented. It is demonstrated that the dependability of the LCD relay can be compromised during internal phase-to-phase faults. The results also show that with the synchronous generation being displaced by CIS, the increasing CIS penetration and fault contribution from the CIS can lead to an increased phase angle difference between the fault currents contributed from the two ends of the protected line, which will increase the risk of the compromised protection performance. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

Therefore, data security and privacy issues are the most challenging problems in WBANs. Moreover, most wearable sensors in WBAN are resource-constrained devices, traditional security schemes may not be suitable for WBAN.

The restriction between access from a user and a shared file of the data owner can be determined by the access policy. In most existing access control models, it is assumed that all entities, including users, the third party, and cloud service provider (CSP), are in the same trust domain. However, in cloud computing environments, it is usually assumed that the CSP cannot be fully trusted, and the data owner (DO) is desired to have the absolute initiative to control data access. This article proposes a blockchain-based access control scheme for cloud computing, in which the DO maintains an access matrix to describe the access policy. Then, the public keys of all nodes and the access matrix are stored in the blockchain, to ensure the security of the proposed scheme. The DOs can encrypt the large shared files once using a symmetric key in a long time. And they also can encrypt the symmetric key in parallel using the public key of authorized users in a short time. Security analysis proves that the proposed scheme is able to prevent outsourced files from unauthorized access and collusion attack. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing baselines in terms of overheads on computation and storage. On average, the computation overhead of the proposed scheme is lower than that of the scheme SVPAC, PpBAC, and Timely CP-ABE by 25.37%, 45.46%, and 36.44%, respectively. The communication overhead of the proposed scheme is lower than that of the scheme Timely CP-ABE by 17.16%, and it is more secure, although it is higher than that of the scheme SVPAC and PpBAC by 5.88% and 39.05%. And the storage overhead of the proposed scheme is lower than that of the scheme SVPAC, PpBAC, and Timely CP-ABE by 59.36%, 20.25%, and 61.88%, respectively. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106303371"

To preserve the privacy of cloud data, data owner often encrypts all sensitive data files, which makes the keyword search application based on plaintext a very challenging task. Therefore, several privacy-preserving keyword search algorithms have been developed recently, and most of these works support only single-data-owner settings. However, there are always more than one data owners in real applications, which are much more complex and challenging than single-owner scenario. To support multi-owner keyword search, those prior search algorithms need to be repeated several times, because each data owner intends to encrypt his own files with a unique private-key separately. It is absolutely not an efficient way. In this paper, we propose a privacy and integrity-preserving multi-owner ranked-keyword search scheme termed PIMRS. In the PIMRS, we exploit an asymmetric scalar-product encryption function based on the TF × IDF rule to preserve data privacy and to obtain more precise search results. Furthermore, a circular bi-direction-linked list based scheme is proposed to preserve the integrity of search results, which also enables the misbehaviors of cloud server to be detected. The security analysis of PIMRS shows its privacy and integrity property, and extensive experiments based on real-world data set confirm the high efficiency of proposed schemes.

In the present scenario, extremely sensitive data is stored in the third-party cloud service provider’s infrastructure. For instance, patients who have direct access to the healthcare system may access the cloud-based health care data at any time based on the needs. Such sensitive data is subjected to various security issues because of the entities from multiple hosts connecting to cloud storage. In the proposed work, an optimized secured data access control mechanism named as modified Chebyshev polynomial-based access control (MCPAC) is presented. In MCPAC scheme, multiple levels of verification and authentications are carried out to provide resilience against widely recognized attacks. The proposed access control scheme is evaluated in a real private cloud infrastructure using the metrics, such as precision, recall and detection rate. It is proved that the proposed MCPAC offers better privacy protection with the precision of 0.8947, recall of 0.8983, and detection rate of 85.63%, which is high as compared to the conventional state-of-the-art methods.

Some of the security vulnerabilities can be detected by static analysis tools and penetration testing, but usually, these suffer from relatively high false positive rates. Software vulnerability prediction (SVP) models can be used to categorize software components into vulnerable and neutral components before the software testing phase and likewise increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall verification process. The performance of a vulnerability prediction model is usually affected by the adopted classification algorithm, the adopted features, and data balancing approaches. In this study, we empirically investigate the effect of these factors on the performance of SVP models. Our experiments consist of four data balancing methods, seven classification algorithms, and three feature types. The experimental results show that data balancing methods are effective for highly unbalanced datasets, text-based features are more useful, and ensemble-based classifiers provide mostly better results.

However, it poses various challenges for IoT networks that cannot handle large amounts of operation technology (OT) data due to physical storage shortages, excessive latency, higher transfer costs, a lack of context awareness, impractical resiliency, and so on. As a result, the fog network emerged as a new computing model for providing computing capacity closer to IoT edge devices. The IoT-Fog-Cloud network, on the other hand, is more vulnerable to multiple security flaws, such as missing key management problems, inappropriate access control, inadequate software update mechanism, insecure configuration files and default passwords, missing communication security, and secure key exchange algorithms over unsecured channels. Therefore, these networks cannot make good security decisions, which are significantly easier to hack than to defend the fog-enabled IoT environment. This paper proposes the cooperative flow for securing edge devices in fog-enabled IoT networks using a permissioned blockchain system (pBCS). The proposed fog-enabled IoT network provides efficient security solutions for key management issues, communication security, and secure key exchange mechanism using a blockchain system. To secure the fog-based IoT network, we proposed a mechanism for identification and authentication among fog, gateway, and edge nodes that should register with the blockchain network. The fog nodes maintain the blockchain system and hold a shared smart contract for validating edge devices. The participating fog nodes serve as validators and maintain a distributed ledger/blockchain to authenticate and validate the request of the edge nodes. The network services can only be accessed by nodes that have been authenticated against the blockchain system. We implemented the proposed pBCS network using the private Ethereum 2.0 that enables secure device-to-device communication and demonstrated performance metrics such as throughput, transaction delay, block creation response time, communication, and computation overhead using state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we conducted a security analysis of the communication network to protect the IoT edge devices from unauthorized malicious nodes without data loss. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168877273"

However, these functions could be compromised by subtle attacks launched by untrusted operating system or other applications, and sensitive keys or cryptographic procedures could then be compromised. In this paper, based on virtualization technology, we propose a novel approach that outsources the cryptographic functions in one virtual machine (VM) into another dedicated VM, so that sensitive keys and the cryptographic procedures are only contained by this VM with specific purpose. We also propose a prototype, called cryptographic function assurance (CFA), to enhance the security of cryptographic functions. Taking OpenSSL as an example, CFA allows those applications that use OpenSSL library to transparently utilize CFA to protect the cryptographic functions.

To protect the confidentiality of sensitive data while supporting deduplication, the convergent encryption technique has been proposed to encrypt the data before outsourcing. However, the issue of keyword search over encrypted data in deduplication storage system has to be addressed for efficient data utilization. This paper firstly proposes two constructions which support secure keyword search in this scenario. In these constructions, the integrity of the data can be realized by just checking the convergent key, without other traditional integrity auditing mechanisms.

It is an internet-based communication that enables access to millions of cloud services. These services are provided using TCP/UDP-based communications and protected by traditional security protocols (e.g., SSL/ TLS/DTLS). However, security threats in cloud communications become the most serious issue nowadays. To address some of the shortcomings of traditional security protocols, we propose a secure cloud communication architecture (Graphene) for both TCP- and UDP-based communications. Graphene can provide security for data-in-transit and authenticity of cloud users and cloud service providers. It protects the communication channel against most common attacks such as man-in-the-middle (including eavesdropping, sniffing, identity spoofing, and data tampering), sensitive information disclosure, replay, compromised-key, repudiation, and session hijacking attacks. This work also involves the designing of a novel high-performance cloud-focused security protocol that works for both TCP and UDP communications. Especially for UDP, it uses an asynchronous re-transmission mechanism to ensure datagram delivery. This protocol efficiently utilizes the strength and speed of symmetric block encryption with Galois/Counter mode, cryptographic hash, public key cryptography, and ephemeral key-exchange. It provides faster reconnection facility for supporting frequent connectivity and dealing with connection trade-offs. The security analysis of Graphene shows promising protection against the above discussed attacks. Graphene also outperforms TLSv1.3 (the latest stable version among the SSL successors) and DTLSv1.2 (the latest stable version of datagram TLS) in performance and bandwidth consumption significantly and shows reasonable memory usage at the server side. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087616858"

This requirement often prevents such systems from usage of computational heavy algorithms for security analysis. To deal with this issue, we built our system based on an in-memory database with an integrated machine learning library, namely, SAP HANA. Three approaches, that is, (1) deep normalisation of log messages, (2) storing data in the main memory and (3) running data analysis directly in the database, allow us to increase processing speed in such a way that machine learning analysis of security events becomes possible nearly in real time. Besides that, we developed a universal anomaly detection algorithm, which uses vector space model to represent and cluster textual log messages. Together with deep normalisation approach, this algorithm solves the problem of correlation for heterogenous security events containing many text fields. To prove our concepts, we measured the processing speed for the developed system on the data generated using Active Directory testbed, compared it with classical system architecture based on PostgreSQL database and showed the efficiency of our approach for high-speed analysis of security events.

METHODS: According to the theory of stream cipher, this method uses Chebyshev map to form encryption key. A series of coding operations are used to set the initial value before image chaos processing. Combining with logical mapping, the original image information is encrypted by chaos from X and Y dimensions. RESULTS: The experimental results show that the NPCR value of the encrypted image is 0.9874 after the blood cells are encrypted.

Therefore, local authorities need to improve their ability to assess weather-related hazards such as floods, landslides, and storms, as well as peoples sensitivity and capacity to cope with or adjust to such events. In this article, we present an integrated assessment of vulnerability to natural hazards, which incorporates both exposure and social vulnerability. In our assessment, we screen places and rank them by their relative scores on exposure and vulnerability indices. We also design a web-based visualization tool - ViewExposed - that shows maps that reveal a considerable geographic variation in integrated vulnerability. ViewExposed makes it easy to identify the places with the highest integrated vulnerability, and it facilitates the understanding of the factors that make these places exposed and/or vulnerable. For empirical validation, we correlate the exposure indices with insurance claims due to natural damage. However, we also emphasize the importance of a dialog with relevant stakeholders to ensure a participatory validation. Our top-down exposure and vulnerability assessment benefits from a participatory bottom-up assessment. This is crucial to support decisions about where to implement adaptive and preventive measures against hazards related to climate change. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938420504"

Outsourcing healthcare data to a cloud environment from IoT devices is very essential as IoT devices are lightweight. To maintain confidentiality and to achieve fine-grained access control, the ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technique is utilized very often in an IoT-based healthcare system for encrypting patients' healthcare data. However, an attribute revocation may affect the other users with the same attribute set, as well as the entire system due to its security concerns. This paper proposes a novel CP-ABE-based fine-grained access control scheme to solve the attribute revocation problem. The proposed technique includes multiple attribute authorities to reduce the work overhead of having a single authority in the traditional CP-ABE systems. In addition, the proposed scheme outsources the decryption process to a decryption assistant entity to reduce the decryption overhead of the end-users. To prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme, both formal security analysis and performance comparisons are presented in this paper.

Therefore, it cannot prevent those advanced code reuse attacks, such as just-in-time return-oriented programming. In view of this situation, we propose an instantaneous and continual address space rerandomization approach, called just-in-time address space rerandomization (JIT-ASR) to thwart the attack. The JIT-ASR uses the virtual memory management and can ceaselessly change the program's address space by modifying the virtual page number of the code address and page table at runtime. In this way, the address space of the program will change continually. This mechanism will make the addresses used by the attacker become stale, and the attack payload cannot be performed successfully. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of JIT-ASR, we apply it to SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite. The evaluation results and security analysis show that JIT-ASR can resist the code reuse attacks, especially just-in-time return-oriented programming, and yield low runtime performance overhead (1.2% on average on the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark).

Specifically, we propose forgery and impersonation attacks on the one-to-one message encryption and the group message encryption. All of our attacks are feasible with the help of an end-to-end adversary, who has access to the inside of the LINE server (e.g. service provider LINE themselves). We stress that the main purpose of E2EE is to provide a protection against the end-to-end adversary.

A broad range of column configurations, selected after archaeological research, was analyzed. Each soil-column configuration was tested with 56 artificial accelerograms in the range of peak ground acceleration between 0.2 and 0.8 g. Fragility curves were created for each configuration and used to quantify the effects of soil, and the slenderness, height, and number of drums of each column. The influence factors of all parameters were used in the assessment form to categorize the columns into vulnerability classes, according to their probability of collapsing when subjected to a certain level of seismic excitation. The proposed tool can be used for rapid, preliminary, seismic vulnerability assessment, without the need for further sophisticated calculations. Four ancient columns, which have survived earthquakes of known acceleration amplitude, were used to apply, test and validate the proposed assessment form. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965112219"

First, they are classified according to the typological, structural, and architectural features. Next, the main failure mechanisms observed in the immediate aftermath of the 2009 earthquake are identified and analyzed, taking into account both the global structural response and the local mechanisms involving specific parts of the churches. Damage related to the local mechanisms is classified by means of scores based on both the severity and extension of the revealed cracks. The single scores are combined to define an index measuring the global damage of each church. Such indices are therefore associated with six damage levels, the frequencies of which are organized into damage probability matrices. These matrices can be used in order to quantitatively evaluate the damage scenarios that the studied population of buildings revealed after the seismic event, as well as to predict the damage level that could be expected on similar churches for future earthquakes. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965132850"

WBAN consists of medical sensors, which continuously monitor the patients’ vital signs and transfers this data to the remote medical server via the cloud. The continuous monitoring of the patients’ health data improves the quality of the medical service and also provides the source for future medical diagnosis. The medical information collected from WBAN is generally transmitted through wireless channel and therefore vulnerable to various information attacks. In this context, medical data security and privacy are key issues; hence there is a requirement of lightweight end-to-end authentication protocol to ensure secure communication. Recently, Li et al. presented a lightweight end-to-end authentication protocol for WBAN based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, through cryptanalysis, some security loopholes are found in this protocol. In this paper, an enhanced lightweight ECC based end-to-end authentication protocol is proposed to overcome the security vulnerabilities of Li et al.’s scheme. Further, the formal security analysis of the proposed scheme is done using BAN logic and AVISPA tool. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme not only removes the security loopholes of Li et al.’s scheme but also reduces the overall complexity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072051076"

Wearable wireless medical sensor nodes allow continuous monitoring by amassing physiological data, which is very useful in healthcare applications. These text data are then sent to doctors via IoT devices so they can make an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible. However, the transmission of medical text data is extremely vulnerable to security and privacy assaults due to the open nature of the underlying communication medium. Therefore, a certificate-less aggregation-based signature system has been proposed as a solution to the issue by using elliptic curve public key cryptography (ECC) which allows for a highly effective technique. The cost of computing has been reduced by 93% due to the incorporation of aggregation technology. The communication cost is 400 bits which is a significant reduction when compared with its counterparts. The results of the security analysis show that the scheme is robust against forging, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The primary innovation is that the time required for signature verification can be reduced by using point addition and aggregation. In addition, it does away with the reliance on a centralized medical server in order to do verification. By taking a distributed approach, it is able to fully preserve user privacy, proving its superiority. © 2023, The Author(s).","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177188384"

To solve these security and efficiency challenges, we define and construct a scheme, whose security relies on the proper erasure of keys in the wrapped key tree and periodical update of the deduplication encryption keys. Moreover, we enhance the efficiency of the proposed scheme by introducing incremental data update, where only the changed part is encrypted/decrypted and uploaded/downloaded in data updating. Further security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure against coercive attack.

We then perform automated security analysis to check the generated configurations against designer-specified security constraints. Following the analysis, we use an automated architecture configuration refinement process to generate a list of security additions that are inserted into the initial configuration so that the security constraints are satisfied.

The model assumes an adversary who has leaked values whose positions are unknown and randomly chosen from internal states (random leakage model). This paper improves the security analysis on AES under the random leakage model. In the previous method, the adversary requires at least 234 chosen plaintexts; therefore, it is hard to recover a secret key with a small number of data. To consider the security against the adversary given a small number of data, we reestimate complexity. We propose another hypothesis-testing method which can minimize the number of required data. The proposed method requires time complexity more than t > 260 because of time-data tradeoff, and some attacks are tractable under t ≥ 280. Therefore, the attack is a threat for the long-term security though it is not for the short-term security. In addition, we apply key enumeration to the differential bias attack and propose two evaluation methods, information-theoretic evaluation and experimental one with rank estimation. From the evaluations on AES, we show that the attack is a practical threat for the long-term security.

Stochastic approaches are more accurate but in general they are computationally expensive and hence not practical for the resilient operational decision-making of distribution system operators.

With the evolution of mobile edge computing, numerous security and privacy issues have been addressed including policy management, authentication, access control, and confidentiality. The technologies such as big-data, Internet of Things, and cloud have improved the development of modern healthcare systems to improve the quality of medical services. It is nowadays integrating the computing methods and communication technologies such as wireless sensor networks, radio frequency identification, smartphones, and location awareness to collect and analyze the physiological data of the patient. The e-Health entities such as medical device, client, and server rely on analytical models to carry out early diagnosis and remote monitoring. As it is based on e-Health applications, a real-time healthcare system is preferred to integrate with mobile cloud computing. Since the medical data are hugely exposed to vulnerabilities, a lightweight privacy-aware secure authentication (LPASA) scheme is presented. To achieve better secure efficiencies, this article is preferable to use lightweight cryptographic operations, namely, one-way hashing function and bitwise exclusive-OR. Moreover, the formal and informal security analysis shows that the proposed LPASA can withstand the possible active and passive attacks such as replay, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, online-guessing, and so forth.

The construction of member list allows the fault tolerance of our scheme against accidental errors. In addition, the batch verification technique is adopted to reduce the computation cost of the operation center, and each user's computation cost is independent of the number of collected data types. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme can resist various security threats and preserve identity privacy and has significantly less communication overhead and computation cost than other existing approaches.

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

Sequential logic locking, watermark insertion, fault-injection assessment of a system-on-a-chip (SoC) control flow, information leakage assessment, and reverse engineering at gate-level abstraction, to name a few, require precise FSM extraction from the synthesized netlist of the design. Unfortunately, no reliable solutions are currently available for fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the highly unstructured gate-level netlist for effective security evaluation. The major challenge in developing such a solution is the precise recognition of FSM state flip-flops (FFs) in a netlist having a massive collection of FFs. In this article, we propose finite state machine extractor ultra (FSMx-Ultra), a framework for extracting FSMs from extremely unstructured gate-level netlists. FSMx-Ultra utilizes state-of-the-art graph theory concepts and algorithms to distinguish FSM state registers from other registers and then constructs gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each identified FSM state register using automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) techniques. The results of our experiments on 14 open-source benchmark designs illustrate that FSMx-Ultra can recover all FSMs quickly and precisely from synthesized gate-level netlists of diverse complexity and size utilizing various state encoding schemes. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153334030"

Unfortunately, two challenging issues (i.e., data security and privacy) dramatically impede the adaption and practicability of cloud storage due to honest-but-curious cloud service provider (CSP). Furthermore, data encryption mechanism seriously makes the information retrieval over ciphertext extremely difficult. Besides, dealing with single CSP is predicted to become less popular with cloud customers for fear of risks of single-point failure threats and potential malicious insiders. To this end, we propose two efficient keyword search over encrypted data in multi-cloud setting schemes which exploit Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE), respectively. Formal security analysis proves that our schemes can guarantee data privacy and reliability. As a further contribution, experimental results over real-world dataset show that our proposed schemes are feasible and efficient in practical applications. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

With the deployment of massive and faster mobile networks, almost every daily-use item is connected to the Internet. IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment is used for the collection and analysis of different types of multimedia data (i.e., images, videos, audios, etc.). This multimedia data is generated by various types of smart devices like drones, robots, smart controller, smart surveillance system which are deployed for the industrial monitoring and control. The multimedia data is generated in the enormous amount which can be considered as the big data. This data is further utilized in various types of business needs for example, chances of fire accidents in the industrial plant, overall machine health, etc., which can be predicted through the application of big data analytics. Therefore, IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment is very helpful to the concerned authorities as they come to know the important information in advance. However, all the smart devices are connected and controlled through the Internet. It further causes severe threats to the communication happens in an IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment. It is vulnerable to various types of attacks such as replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, secret information leakage, sensitive information modification, and malware injection (i.e., mirai). Therefore, it is important to prevent the communication of such an environment against the different types of possible attacks. These days, the attacks performed by botnets (i.e., malware attacks such as mirai and reaper) have drawn attention to the researchers. Under the influence of such attacks, the communication of IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment is disrupted. Moreover, the attackers may also control the smart devices remotely and can change their functionalities. Hence, we need some robust mechanism to detect the presence of the malware attacks in such an environment. In this paper, we propose a malware detection mechanism in IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment with the help of machine-learning approach, which is named as MADP-IIME. MADP-IIME uses four different types of machine learning methods (i.e., naive bayes, logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest) to detect the presence of malware attacks successfully. Furthermore, MADP-IIME performs better than other related existing schemes and achieves 99.5 % detection and 0.5 % false positive rate. In addition, the conducted security analysis proves the resilience of the proposed MADP-IIME against different types of malware attacks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099586801"

NSA presented the specification and the implementation efficiency, but they did not provide detailed security analysis nor the design rationale. The original Simon has rotation constants of (1; 8; 2), and Kölbl et al. regarded the constants as a parameter (a; b; c), and analyzed the security of Simon block cipher variants against differential and linear attacks for all the choices of (a; b; c). This paper complements the result of Kölbl et al. by considering integral and impossible differential attacks. First, we search the number of rounds of integral distinguishers by using a supercomputer. Our search algorithm follows the previous approach byWang et al., however, we introduce a new choice of the set of plaintexts satisfying the integral property. We show that the new choice indeed extends the number of rounds for several parameters. We also search the number of rounds of impossible differential characteristics based on the miss-in-the-middle approach. Finally, we make a comparison of all parameters from our results and the observations by Kölbl et al. Interesting observations are obtained, for instance we find that the optimal parameters with respect to the resistance against differential attacks are not stronger than the original parameter with respect to integral and impossible differential attacks. Furthermore, we consider the security against differential attacks by considering differentials. From the result, we obtain a parameter that is potential to be better than the original parameter with respect to security against these four attacks. © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040190726"

Contact tracing scheme based on Bluetooth of smartphones has been regarded as a viable way to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. The existing schemes mainly belong to the centralized or the decentralized structure, both of which have their own limitations. It is infeasible for the existing schemes to balance the different demands of governments and users for user privacy and tracing efficiency at different periods of the epidemic. In this paper, we propose a hybrid contact tracing scheme named MLCT (multi-level contact tracing scheme) which is mainly based on short group signature. MLCT provides multiple privacy levels by applying anonymous credential technology and secret sharing technology to desensitize user identity privacy and encounter privacy. Comparing to the previous schemes, MLCT fully considers the different demands of the government, patients, and close contacts for user privacy and tracing efficiency in the different stages of Covid-19. The experimental results show viability in terms of the required resource from both server and mobile phone perspectives. And the security analysis demonstrates that MLCT can achieve the five targets security goals. It is expected that MLCT can contribute to the design and development of contact tracing schemes. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126294202"

This paper presents a novel method for biometric cryptosystem based on fuzzy vault using palmprint features. Initially, pre-processing is performed to remove noise in palmprint enrolled image and to pre-align image automatically. Bottom-hat filtering is employed for the feature extraction from the palmprint images. A polynomial is evaluated from the secret key and this polynomial is used to generate projections from palmprint features. Fuzzy vault is created by combining projected points with randomly generated dummy or chaff points. During decoding process, matching scores are calculated by comparing the query feature and stored vault. The vault is successfully decoded when the matched scores should be greater than a predefined threshold value. Experiments were conducted on CASIA database. Simulation result demonstrates that the proposed method gives better performance than other methods and improves the robustness against some security attacks. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047667045"

The gathered real-time medical data is transferred through an insecure channel which may lead to several security attacks. To secure from these attacks, the methodology adopted in this work involves the use of a lightweight secure anonymous authentication scheme with location privacy and the implementation of a WBAN system using a cadence tool. Moreover, the methodology encompasses several stages, including initialization, registration, authentication, and location privacy. Further, the study adopts a systematic approach to address key challenges, such as integrity, privacy, security, and non-repudiation. The hypothesis underlying this research is that WBANs can provide accurate and real-time healthcare monitoring using an anonymous authentication scheme and validated by using cadence software. In this work, a digital signature-based cryptographic technique is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the messages. The security analysis section proves that the system is efficient in resisting different security attacks. Though there are several existing works related to authentication, the proposed protocol is very efficient in terms of performance analysis parameters which are validated using Cygwin software. Computational cost is diminished by 13% and communication overhead is reduced by 32% when compared to the relevant recent works. Additionally, a practical hardware approach is designed using a Verilog Hardware description language and implemented in hardware on an Arty A7-100 SoC FPGA (Silicon on Chip Field Programmable Gate Array) Development board where the number of bonded IOBs utilization is only 10% and lastly synthesized using a Cadence tool with CMOS GPDK 90 nm technology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163682110"

The network is tapped by an external eavesdropper (Eve) who is equipped with a large number of antennas. In addition to the transmission of several (unicast) information signals to downlink users (Bobs), the transmitter (Alice) generates friendly jamming (FJ), aiming to prevent Eve from decoding Alice's signals. To mitigate both multiuser interference (MUI) and FJ on Bobs, MU-MIMO systems often rely on zero-forcing (ZF) precoders. A condition for the application of such precoders is that the network must be underloaded, i.e., Alice has more antennas than all Bobs combined. For overloaded scenarios, ZF-based precoding cannot guarantee nullification of both MUI and FJ at legitimate receivers. Accordingly, we propose a combined signaling-and-precoding scheme that can also be applied to an overloaded MU-MIMO network. In an underloaded scenario, our technique is shown to impose a more stringent antenna requirement on Eve than a classical ZF-based precoding, i.e., Eve must utilize more antennas if she is to successfully eavesdrop on Alice's transmissions. Although our scheme is comparable to antenna selection (AS) approaches in terms of Eve's antenna requirement, it incurs much less delay and complexity by avoiding frequent on/off switching of the RF chains at Bobs. For underloaded scenarios, we provide security analysis that establishes the conditions under which our scheme is superior to the ZF scheme. Using computer simulations, we validate the advantages of our design and contrast it with ZF and AS schemes in terms of the symbol error rate, the EVM, and the achievable rate in both underloaded and overloaded scenarios. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153493515"

However, existing MIKEY modes fail to meet the requirements of low-power and low-processing devices. To address this issue, we combine two previously proposed approaches to introduce a new compressed and distributed MIKEY mode applied to a collaborative internet of things context. A set of third parties is used to discharge the constrained nodes from heavy computational operations. Doing so, the MIKEY pre-shared mode is used in the constrained part of network, while the public key mode is used in the unconstrained part of the network. Furthermore, to mitigate the communication cost we introduce a new header compression scheme that reduces the size of MIKEY’s header from 12 bytes to 3 bytes in the best compression case. To assess our approach, we performed a detailed security analysis using a formal validation tool (i.e., Avispa). In addition, we performed an energy evaluation of both communicational and computational costs. The obtained results show that our proposed mode is energy preserving whereas its security properties are preserved untouched.

However, since the main idea behind such protocol is to hierarchically peel the IP head and decode each crypted routing address, the topology with regards to path length or long-term direction cannot be preserved. Owing to topology exposure, lots of attacks such as denial of service and differential flow analysis can be effectively conducted to violate the security of it. Moreover, considering that the path should be constructed by a sender in advance, onion routing is infeasible to be transplanted to ad hoc networks, let alone other defects such as heavy burden about computational complexity and package length. In this paper, a topology-hiding routing protocol is proposed to address most of the aforementioned problems recurring to homomorphic learning with errors. Security analysis illustrated that nothing but only the IPs of adjacent hops will be revealed to any router. Also the computational complexity on sender side as well as the package length outperforms those of traditional onion routing algorithm in view of comparative simulation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082194065"

Therefore, searchable encryption(SE) technology becomes a fundamental solution to search over encrypted data in outsourcing service. However, the genuine safety of SE schemes should concentrate not only on keyword privacy but also on user privacy as information tracking may leak user identity. For example, in the personal health record system, the malicious CSP may match sensitive disease information(cancer or AIDS) with certain patient. In addition, practical SE scheme should not be confined to single-user setting because of its limitations. While SE schemes applied to multi-user setting may result in additional secret key and ciphertext updating burden due to frequent user revocation. Along this direction, we define a revocable and anonymous SE scheme in multiple-user setting, which is scalable and efficient in user revocation and anonymity.

This paper proposes a lightweight privacy-preserving electricity consumption aggregation scheme that exploits lightweight lattice-based homomorphic cryptosystem. In the proposed scheme, smart household appliances aggregate their readings without involving the smart meter. Although smart meters or the intermediate base station cannot decrypt this aggregated consumption, they can validate the message's authenticity. The proposed scheme also investigates the impact of different types of smart appliances on the home area network's overhead. The total communication and computation load for the proposed scheme is trivial and tolerable by different parties in the connection, i.e., smart appliances, smart meters, and the base station. In addition, the deployed cryptosystem, which depends on simple arithmetic operations, can further reduce the computation duty for smart appliances.

The infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud service model is mainly addressed to extend and complement the previous Trusted Computing techniques for secure VM launch and VM migration case. The VM migration solution proposed in this paper uses a Trust_Token based to guarantee that the user VMs can only be migrated and hosted on a trustworthy and/or compliant cloud platforms. The possibility to also check the compliance of the cloud platforms with the pre-defined baseline configurations makes our solution compatible with an existing widely accepted standards-based, security-focused cloud frameworks like FedRAMP. Our proposed solution can be used for both inter- and intra-cloud VM migrations. Different from previous schemes, our solution is not dependent on an active (on-line) trusted third party; that is, the trusted third party only performs the platform certification and is not involved in the actual VM migration process.

However, a complete understanding of how to treat patients suffering from AF is still not achieved. As the isolation of the pulmonary veins in the left atrium (LA) is the standard treatment for AF, the role of the right atrium (RA) in AF is rarely considered. We investigated the impact of including the RA on arrhythmia vulnerability in silico. We generated a dataset of five mono-Atrial (LA) and five bi-Atrial models with three different electrophysiological (EP) setups each, regarding different states of AF-induced remodelling. For every model, a pacing protocol was run to induce reentries from a set of stimulation points. The average share of inducing points across all EP setups was 0.0, 0.8 and 6.7% for the mono-Atrial scenario, 0.5, 27.3 and 37.9% for the biatrial scenario. The increase in inducibility of LA stimulation points from mono-to bi-Atrial scenario was 0.91 ± 2.03%, 34.55 ± 14.9% and 44.2 ± 14.9 %, respectively.

These applications usually generate plenty of cooperative files, which share their ownerships with all collaborative participants. Data deduplication is a promising solution to improve the storage efficiency and save the user expenditure. However, it remains an open issue on how to securely prove the shared ownerships for the shared files and address the attacks on account of using data deduplication. To tackle the above issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel concept of the Proof of Shared oWnership (PoSW) and construct a secure multi-server-aided PoSW (ms-PoSW) scheme for securing client-side deduplication for the shared files, which is based on the convergent encryption, secret sharing, and bloom filter. In the ms-PoSW scheme, we employ a sharing convergent key to avoid the single point of failure, introduce the secret sharing algorithm to implement the shared ownership, and construct a novel interaction protocol between the shared owners and the cloud server to prove the shared ownership. Furthermore, a hybrid PoSW scheme is constructed to address the secure proof of hybrid cloud architectures.

Besides OEM apps and services, the next generation of IVI platforms are expected to offer integration of third-party apps. Under this anticipated business model, vehicular sensor and event data can be collected and shared with selected third-party apps. To accommodate this trend, Google has been pushing towards standardization among proprietary IVI operating systems with their Android Automotive platform which runs natively on the vehicle's IVI platform. Unlike Android Auto's limited functionality of display-projecting certain smartphone apps to the IVI screen, Android Automotive will have access to the in-vehicle network (IVN), and will be able to read and share various vehicular sensor data with third-party apps. This increased connectivity opens new business opportunities for both the car manufacturer as well as third-party businesses, but also introduces a new attack surface on the vehicle. Therefore, Android Automotive must have a secure system architecture to prevent any potential attacks that might compromise the security and privacy of the vehicle and the driver. In particular, malicious third-party entities could remotely compromise a vehicle's functionalities and impact the vehicle safety, causing financial and operational damage to the vehicle, as well as compromise the driver's privacy and safety. This paper presents an Android Automotive system architecture and provides guidelines for conducting a high-level security analysis. It also describes what countermeasures have already been taken by Google to prevent potential attacks, and discusses what still needs to be done in order to offer a secure and privacy-preserving Android experience for next-generation IVI platforms. © 2020 SAE International.

In this context, cloud computing platforms can be adopted as a practical solution for storage and computations. However, sharing such sensitive information with cloud providers can lead to violating privacy preservation and public regulations. To resolve this problem, homomorphic encryption (HE) can be used. Homomorphic encryption enables computation over encrypted data, which helps tackling the problem of privacy preservation. Despite this advantage, existing HE schemes suffer from high computational complexity and storage overhead; designing a practical HE scheme that provides simultaneously the efficiency and the required level of security still remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud based scheme for storing and analyzing classified genetic data using homomorphic encryption (HE). In our scheme, we adopted an optimization technique based on decomposing a homomorphic cipher text into a number of independent cipher texts with lower storage overhead using the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Optimization is then accomplished by applying parallel processing over the independent cipher texts. The presented technique is applied to improve the efficiency of two well-known HE schemes: the Domingo Ferrer (DF) and the Paillier cryptosystems. After examining the correctness of the proposed optimization, it is used to design a secure cloud-based application dedicated for genome data analysis. A virtual cloud environment was created for this purpose. Different performance and security analyses have shown the efficiency of such solution and its compatibility with real-world applications. The execution time is reduced to more than half while maintaining a high security level. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114860570"

The proposed protocol adopts secure multiparty computation and homomorphic encryption methods to realize three properties, i.e., the confidentiality of nodes location information, the integrity of the message carried distance, and the correctness of reputation computation. Furthermore, this incentive scheme can satisfy the following security requirements, such as mutual authentication, non-repudiation, and conditional privacy preservation, and it can also stimulate the active helpers and suppress harmful behaviors fairly and reasonably.

One of the major attacking channels is utilizing the firmware of IoT devices as the access interface to compromise the targeted IoT devices.

In this paper, a secure and verifiable blockchain-based firmware update framework for IoT environment is proposed. The aims of the proposed framework are providing secure peer-to-peer verification mechanism on each new version of firmware released by corresponding device manufacturer and providing a reliable way to distribute the updated firmware to IoT devices in timely manner. Furthermore, the utilization of blockchain technology in the proposed framework ensures the integrity of firmware during its distribution through Internet. The proposed firmware update framework consists of four processes: creation of firmware update contract, creation of third-party firmware update contract, PUSH update mechanism and PULL update mechanism. Six corresponding protocols are derived to support the four processes. The evaluation on performance and security strength of the proposed firmware update framework is conducted.

Existing research considers the FDI attack in the context of the ability to change a measurement in a static system only. However, successful attacks will require first intrusion into a system followed by construction of an attack vector that can bypass bad data detection to cause a consequence (such as overloading). Furthermore, the recent development of moving target defences (MTD) introduces dynamically changing system topology, which is beyond the capability of existing research to assess. In this way, we develop a full service framework for FDI risk assessment. The framework considers both the costs of system intrusion via a weighted graph assessment in combination with a physical, line overload-based vulnerability assessment under the existence of MTD. We present our simulations on a IEEE 14-bus system with an overlain RTU network to model the true risk of intrusion. The cyber model considers multiple methods of entry for the FDI attack including meter intrusion, RTU intrusion and combined style attacks.

However, user location privacy is vulnerable during service exchange, and location-related queries may result in serious privacy disclosure issues. In this article, considering that attackers may make use of auxiliary information to track a mobile user, we propose a real-time privacy-preserving scheme based on the grouping of queries in continuous LBS. In this scheme, we first design the probability density functions to select (Figure presented.) virtual locations. Then, we group these virtual locations and the query location of the user into several queries. Simultaneously, we send these grouping queries to the LBS server. Following the steps outlined above, grouping queries can be used to conceal the true query. Moreover, the results of security analyses and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme is effective and secure. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140110591"

However, in the real applications, we may have a situation where a user needs to share a session key with server A, but the authentication needs to be done by a different server B that shares the password with the user. Further, to achieve higher security on the server side, it may be required to make PAKE tolerant of a server breach by having multiple authentication servers. To deal with such a situation, Abdalla et al. proposed a variant of PAKE called Gateway Threshold PAKE (GTPAKE) where a gateway corresponds to the aforementioned server A being an online service provider and also a potential adversary that may try to guess the passwords. However, the schemes of Abdalla et al. turned out to be vulnerable to Undetectable On-line Dictionary Attack (UD on DA). In this paper, we propose the first GTPAKE provably secure against UD on DA, and in the security analysis, we prove that our GTPAKE is secure even if an adversary breaks into parts of multiple authentication servers.

In the 5G IoV, a large number of deployed 5G base stations are integrated into it, which has further developed the technologies such as seamless handover, load balancing, and security authentication. The development of the IoV has largely alleviated the traffic pressure and improved the driving efficiency. However, there are many privacy security problems to be solved in 5G IoV. Therefore, with the characteristics of blockchain distribution, traceability, and non-tampering, an efficient privacy protection authentication protocol based on blockchain is proposed. The method includes two parts: identity registration and authentication. Vehicles and other traffic participants obtain a public identity block through identity registration before accessing the IoV. In the subsequent authentication, the communication parties use this identity block for anonymous authentication. The analysis results based on the formal analysis software Scyther are safe. The security analysis shows that the scheme could meet the security requirements in the IoV. At the same time, the comparison with the existing schemes shows that this scheme has lower computation overhead and communication cost. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Conference paper","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135247149"

In most existing multi-authority attribute-based encryption schemes, a global identifier (GID) is introduced to act as the linchpin to resist collusion attacks. Because GID as well as some sensitive attributes used to apply for secret keys will lead to the compromise of user's privacy, some schemes towards solving these privacy issues have been proposed. Nevertheless, only the privacy of GID was considered in prior works. Recently in ESORICS 2014, Han et al. put forward a privacy-preserving decentralized ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme in the standard model to address the additive privacy of attributes. In their work, a privacy-preserving key extract protocol is presented to protect both user's identifier and attributes. In this paper, we point out the security weakness of the scheme of Han et al.

Blockchain systems, like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, rely on sophisticated middleware, which enables the execution of smart contracts. Smart contracts define the business logic within cooperative applications. Detecting attacks and vulnerabilities within blockchain is a crucial issue for ensuring the security of different generations of blockchains. Testing a blockchain application serves multiple purposes: it ensures its quality, maximizes test coverage, and minimizes the risks associated with insufficient knowledge that could potentially impact the software development process. That is why several static analysis tools targeting Ethereum smart contracts and Hyperledger Fabric chaincode have recently been proposed by the blockchain research community. However, the efficiency of these analysis tools remains an open issue that requires further investigation. In this context, this paper presents a new taxonomy related to attacks targeting different generations of blockchain and evaluates the available analysis tools that can be utilized to assess the resilience of blockchain 2.0 and blockchain 3.0 against a range of vulnerabilities and attacks. Additionally, this study presents two quantitative analyses: one assessing the performance of tools in evaluating smart contract vulnerabilities within blockchain 2.0, and another analyzing the performance of tools in assessing blockchain 3.0 vulnerabilities within chaincode. Furthermore, this comprehensive study holds value for the research community as it considers various generations of blockchain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.","Conference paper","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174168784"

To address this problem, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) delivery such as drone delivery has been proposed and widely accepted as a promising solution. However, currently most of the existing UAV delivery systems are based on Cloud Computing which cannot efficiently meet the requirements of many real-time services in UAV delivery systems. Meanwhile, the security issues in UAV delivery systems also raise critical concerns due to the existence of multiple participants (such as the sender, middler, and receiver) who may not maintain a mutual trust relationship among them. How to secure the UAV delivery process in such an untrusted environment is still a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and blockchain-based UAV delivery system to resolve the “last mile” problem in logistics. Specifically, based on the MEC architecture, the blockchain nodes are deployed on the edge nodes to facilitate and secure the UAV delivery process. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution, a MEC-based UAV delivery system prototype with a private blockchain on the Ethereum platform is implemented. Through the security analysis and performance evaluation, it is proven that our proposed solution can effectively solve the “last mile” problem and address the security issues in UAV delivery systems. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097022313"

The proposed protocol achieves mutual authentication between a device and the fog server with the help of cloud server called three-way authentication procedure. Security analyses of the proposed protocol show that it is robust against several attacks. Moreover, the performance of the proposed protocol has been evaluated and compared with other related protocols in terms of communication and storage cost.

The first step of STPA-Sec requires the analyst to identify the system boundary and list the system losses and hazards. Current approach to performing this first and critical step of STPA-Sec requires interviewing the stakeholders and could potentially result in a narrow focus due to stakeholder's mental model and resulting answers to questions. In some cases, stakeholders are not available for interviews and we risk influencing the system loss identification by the mental model of the analyst. We believe these two potential issues in the STPA-Sec analysis: Narrow focus and missing access to stakeholder, can be address by factoring additional system information through stakeholder analysis. To illustrate the benefit of this approach a mining system is considered. Stakeholders in the mining system are identified and then classified based on the role that they play in the expected emergent behavior of the system. Stakeholder needs are identified and ranked. A stakeholder value network (map) is created with stakeholder as nodes and value exchanges between them representing the connections. A ranked list of value exchanges is created based on the impact of cybersecurity on the stakeholder map. System level-losses are identified from high impact value exchanges, which can then be fed into the step 1 of STPA-Sec analysis. A system level goal statement, derived from the stakeholder analysis, is used as a guiding statement and an aid in drawing a boundary around the system. © 2020 SAE International.

Tiny low-end devices such as sensor networks nodes and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags are of particular importance due to their vulnerability to security attacks, whichmakes protecting their communication privacy and authenticity an essentialmatter. In thiswork,we present a lightweight do-it-all cryptographic design that offers the basic underlying functionalities to secure embedded communication systems in tiny devices. Specifically, we revisit the design approach of the sLiSCP family of lightweight cryptographic permutations,whichwas proposed in SAC 2017. sLiSCP is designed to be used in a unified duplex sponge construction to provide minimal overhead for multiple cryptographic functionalitieswithin one hardware design. The design of sLiSCP follows a 4-subblock Type-2 Generalized Feistel-like Structure (GFS) with unkeyed round-reduced Simeck as the round function, which are extremely efficient building blocks in terms of their hardware area requirements. In sLiSCP-light, we tweak the GFS design and turn it into an elegant Partial Substitution-Permutation Network construction, which further reduces the hardware areas of the sLiSCP permutations by around 16% of their original values. The new design also enhances the bit diffusion and algebraic properties of the permutations and enables us to reduce the number of steps, thus achieving a better throughput in both the hashing and authentication modes. We perform a thorough security analysis of the new design with respect to its diffusion, differential and linear, and algebraic properties. For sLiSCP-light-192, we report parallel implementation hardware areas of 1,820 (respectively, 1,892)GE in CMOS 65nm (respectively, 130nm) ASIC. The areas for sLiSCP-light-256 are 2,397 and 2,500GE in CMOS 65nm and 130nm ASIC, respectively. Overall, the unified duplex sponge mode of sLiSCP-light-192, which provides (authenticated) encryption and hashing functionalities, satisfies the area (1,958GE), power (3.97μW ), and throughput (44.4kbps) requirements of passive RFID tags. © 2018 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052709032"

First, we propose a set of mutational operators tailored to evaluate three types of sensitivity analysis, flow, path and context sensitivity. Then we developed mutators to automatically generate mutants for those types. We demonstrated the framework on a subset of mutational operators to evaluate three taint-flow analysers, SaINT, Taint-Things and FlowsMiner. Our framework and experiments ranked the taint analysis tools according to precision and recall as follows: Taint-Things (99% recall, 100% precision), FlowsMiner (100% recall, 87.6% precision) and SaINT (100% recall, 56.8% precision).

Aiming at the problem of mining the potential value of medical data and realizing secure sharing, a fine-grained medical data sharing scheme based on federated learning is proposed. The scheme uses collaboration-oriented attribute-based encryption technologies to formulate fine-grained access strategies, allowing medical institutions or doctors to decrypt individually or collaboratively with certain conditions to achieve the purpose of accurately screening the required medical data. In the proposed scheme, the model parameters are shared such that the screened medical data is modeled and analyzed based on federated learning, which allows more people to enjoy top medical resources. In addition, a blockchain-based incentive mechanism is used to reward medical institutions which are either honest with high-quality or helpful in decryption. Hence, the enthusiasm of various medical institutions to screen data and participate in federal learning is improved.

The mounted cameras on the vehicles along with the fixed roadside cameras are utilized to provide pictorial services for IoV users and law enforcement agencies. For such forensic services, ensuring the security and privacy of vehicles while guaranteeing the efficiency of data transmission among vehicles is important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight incentive authentication scheme (LIAS) for forensic services in IoV. LIAS is developed on a three-tier architecture containing cloud layer, fog layer, and user layer. LIAS uses pairing-free certificateless signcryption, pseudonym update mechanism, and incentive mechanism to realize a secure anonymous authentication efficiently. We conduct correctness and security analysis, as well as performance analysis and evaluation to validate the high security and efficiency of LIAS. Experimental results reveal that, the communication and computation overheads as well as the message delay and packet loss of LIAS are much lower than those of state-of-the-art techniques. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the security and privacy issues of forensic services in IoV for intelligent transportation. Our goal is to improve the security and privacy of vehicles while guaranteeing the lightweight and incentive of data transmission among the vehicles. Fog-assisted IoV is introduced to fully utilize the capacities of near-user edge devices as well as the connections between fog nodes and devices. However, it still faces the difficulties in ensuring vehicles' security and privacy. Moreover, vehicles' information dissemination could be easily monitored because of the unavoidable defect of wireless communication. Thereby, it is essential to guarantee the security and privacy of vehicles while enhancing the efficiency of vehicles' data transmission during the forensic service. To this end, this paper proposes a lightweight conditional anonymous authentication scheme for forensic services in IoV, which is developed based on the pairing-free technique to achieve secure anonymous authentication with high efficiency. This paper also designs a user tracing mechanism, incentive mechanism, and pseudonym update mechanism to realize safe and effective forensic service in IoV.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128671754"

Linear static and dynamic finite element analyses are developed using a three-dimensional model of the whole church employing the commercial code ABAQUS. The three-dimensional model was realized using shell elements to model the midplane masonry walls. Fundamental frequencies of the cathedral in the main horizontal directions are derived by means of the finite element analysis. Non-linear static analysis on a transversal section with horizontal forces adopted to represent the seismic action, known as pushover analysis, has been carried out to estimate the seismic response of the structure. The analyses have been carried out under conditions of constant gravity loads and monotonically increasing horizontal loads. In this case, the finite element model will be a two-dimensional plane stress model. In particular, masonry has been schematised as an anisotropic medium, whose yield criterion is derived using homogenisation, starting form a block structure with periodic texture. The adopted macroscopic model is shown to retain memory of the mechanical characteristics of the joints and of the shape of the blocks. © Civil-Comp Press, 2015.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964336851"

Kiltz et al. proved that their protocols were provably secure against active attackers. However, they did not refer to the security against man-in-the-middle (MIM) attackers. In this paper, we analyze the security of the protocols against the MIM attacks and reveal the vulnerabilities. More concretely, we propose MIM attacks on them and evaluate authentication rounds required in these attacks precisely. We assume that the tag and reader share a 2l-bit secret key. The expected number of authentication rounds to recover the secret information in the first and second protocol is at most 2l + 2 and 4l + 4, respectively. These attacks do not contradict the proof of security since the MIM attack is located outside the attack model that Kiltz et al. considered.

Buckling of railways in plan, or lateral buckling, is localised and is akin to the buckling of shallow arches. The mechanics of the buckling phenomenon of railway tracks is relatively complex, and a number of approaches have been proposed in the scientific literature, based on limiting assumptions. Moreover, commercial finite element programs have been shown to be unsuitable for modelling the full range temperature-deflection response, because the algorithms for solving the geometric non-linear problem are not tractable to thermal loading. These formulations are deterministic, but the parameters that affect the buckling are stochastic, and so a realistic vulnerability assessment of railway buckling must consider the chance of buckling from a probabilistic basis. Using a fundamental model based on the non-linear response of shallow arches developed elsewhere by the author, this paper proposes an alternative deterministic formulation for railway instability caused by thermal straining, and it considers buckling in a lateral mode for which resistance is provided by the ballast, modelled as being plastic in shear. The deterministic formulation is tractable to Monte Carlo simulation, allowing for a rational probabilistic assessment of the vulnerability of buckling of railways and of the rationale for their adaptation. © Civil-Comp Press, 2014.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963756894"

However, the security benefits provided by the RPKI are accomplished via an architecture that empowers centralized authorities to unilaterally revoke any IP prefixes under their control. We propose mechanisms to improve the transparency of the RPKI, in order to mitigate the risk that it will be used for IP address takedowns. First, we present tools that detect and visualize changes to the RPKI that can potentially take down an IP prefix. We use our tools to identify errors and revocations in the production RPKI. Next, we propose modifications to the RPKI's architecture to (1) require any revocation of IP address space to receive consent from all impacted parties, and (2) detect when misbehaving authorities fail to obtain consent. We present a security analysis of our architecture, and estimate its overhead using data-driven analysis.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924424627"

Based on in-field ambient vibration measurements made with sensors located on building floors, seismic vulnerability evaluation of buildings can be performed. The process makes use of a new three-dimensional seismic assessment method (3D-SAM). This method can be employed for the evaluation of global seismic demand parameters which are directly derived from the experimental modal properties. Examples that validate and illustrate the method are presented in this paper. These case studies are buildings used as community centres and they have been designated as post-critical shelters in the city of Montréal (Québec, Canada). Implementing the 3D-SAM method for seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings is aligned with the purpose of using state-of-the-art interdisciplinary technologies to further facilitate and advance the structural engineering science. © Civil-Comp Press, 2014.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963594596"

The maximum PGA was registered as 0.88g. A great deal of damage occurred but fortunately there was no loss of life or serious injuries. Insurance against natural disasters is obligatory for all buildings in Iceland. After the earthquake a field survey was carried out that covered every damaged structure in the affected area. The damage data was linked to the official land registry database, which contains detailed information on all buildings in Iceland. The data was used to develop probabilistic vulnerability functions and fragility curves for five types of low-rise building classes, which covers the majority of all properties in the region. Four intensity levels were used in the analysis. The damage data was classified into structural and non-structural damage categories and furthermore listed in a number of subcategories. The main findings were that these buildings have relatively good earthquake resistance and that the structural damage was low. Most of the monetary loss was related to non-structural cosmetic damage of interior walls that needed small repairs and paintwork and flooring that required replacement. © Civil-Comp Press, 2014.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963576368"
